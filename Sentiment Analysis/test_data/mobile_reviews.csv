Amazon is very supportive as they had send the technician to check the cell phone and I only have a support from AmazonThank you Amazon for ur support",2

Oppo Find X2,1,Wastage,Waste of money on chinese brands,1
Oppo Find X2,5,Eventfull introduction to the Oppo flagship,"My experience started really eventfully. The device which was delivered failed to switch on. Thanks to Amazon's customer Care a replacement arrived, but that too not without some drama. To replace a mobile the process followed by the delivery agent is that they need to verify the IMEI in the device. However they can't see it if device cannot be switched on. One more iteration with customer service and finally the phone was delivered. Happy with the performance so far but intial hassles could be avoided if there was better quality control at the manufacturers end.",2
Oppo Find X2,4,good,good,4
Oppo Find X2,5,Really mind blowing display,"Excellent camera quality n display i ever seen before, no heating n screen issues. Good battery backup time, i just amazed with its superfast charging. When compared with 8 pro, find x2 is much far far better in all aspects,  especially in sound quality is really awesome both in phone as well as in head phones also. Overall performance is really really good. Iam very much satisfied with this product. Thx AMAZON.  if anyone wants to buy this product then u can blindly go for it.    ",2

Samsung Galaxy S10,1,Amazon's Horrible Customer Service,We bought this cell phone with no cost EMI for 9 month two weeks ago. Today we get a call from the bank that we will be charged an interest of 5K. We call up amazon and they said that we didn't select no cost EMI. Literally 3 of were sitting while buying this product and ensured to pick no cost EMI. The website showed that it was selected. Amazon says that it's our issue but not sure how the hell 3 people can be wrong. There's a glitch on their website. Amazon's customer service was just not helpful and didn't give any solution. They just threw the blame on us and didn't bother to help. Felt like they didn't want to do one thing to help despite us being a loyal customer for years. Please be wary about buying expensive electronics from Amazon. The horrible outcomes of buying from here outweigh any possible benefits.,1
Samsung Galaxy S10,4,Product-S10,"Can someone please clarify?I received this lovely gadget. Without inserting the SIM, I used the product for around 15 mins on wi-fi. Just setting up Samsung account and emails. But to my surprise I found that the product heats up immediately. This is with just 15 minutes of usage and which has disappointed me. I am a fan of S series and in my earlier S series I never found such problem with so less amount of usage.Should I raise a request for replacement?I hope you'll give your genuine opinion/feedback.",2

You will find a better front camera in cheaper A71 Performance of the phone is good. No lag, no crashes. The only part of the phone which I did not like is Samsung bloatware (A lot)  I disabled whichever Samsung allows me to disable. I bought the phone @49000, now the price is dropped again. Overall I am very much satisfied with value and utility",5
